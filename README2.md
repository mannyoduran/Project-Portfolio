# 4. Case Study College Dropout Prediction Analysis

a.    This case study showcases a recent College Dropout Prediction Analysis Project for the American Public University System. The recent college system has seen a staggering number of students beginning to drop out and not finish their degree. The American Public University System collected data to get ahead of the issues and attempt to decrease the number of dropouts that occur year in and year out. For our source data for this project, we have teamed up with several collegiate universities including: Arizona State, Iowa State, Oklahoma State and The University of Alabama. By reviewing the Universities records, the team aspires to discover actionable insights based on analysis.

a.    Coding assignment that assists in helping MLB Los Angeles Dodgers discover the best day to run a marking promotion, so they can get more fans in attendance. With in the assignment EDA was created using BOXPLOTS and DOT PLOTS. After EDA model creation was generated using Regression. 

# 6. Case Study Harrah's Casino Lifetime Value Prediction Analysis

a.    This case study showcases a recent Harrah’s Casino Prediction Analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). CLV is value that helps create a prediction of how much a customer will spend over the long term. Harrah’s Casino is then able to utilize CLV to generate more profit for their casinos by creating plans to keep customers who spend more long term. These marketing plans including mailing, email, and rewards system programs. The more higher spending customers Harrah’s keep the more money that the Casino can generate. The source data from this project was data on customers over the last ten years from several higher populated Harrah’s locations which include: Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Florida, and Arizona. By reviewing this customer data records, Harrah’s Analytics team aspires to discover actionable insights to help develop high profiled marketing plans to keep our more profitable clients. 

# 7. Austin Housing Prediction Analysis Paper

a.    The Austin,Texas Metro area has seen an increase in population of 34% compared to the 2010 Census confirmed by the most recent Census data released in May of 2021. These new settlers are looking for affordable housing as they move into the newest tech hub outside of the traditional hubs like Silicon Valley and Seattle. Our team was tasked with building a machine learning model that will take our housing data and train against that data to make predictions on housing prices in the Austin area. We were given a data set with over 15,000 rows all containing various features and information that Zillow contains for analysis. Our goal was to accurately predict the prices of homes in the Austin market for families and individuals coming to work in the rapidly growing area. In the beginning we had to analyze the data and begin our prepping for the model we built. We updated features from human language to model ready input. With further analysis we then began to split and train the data trying to add or delete irrelevant features from the training data. To ensure we were getting the most accurate predictions of the home prices. We ended up trying three different models starting at 36% accuracy and ending with our most accurate model at 58% which was very close to our initial target of 60%. From our analysis, we believe we have created a stepping stone to provide value to our customers when searching for a home in the Austin Metro area. This model could be used in other markets to provide value,insight and drive more views to Zillow.com. New users could look for a new home as well as analyze markets that are rapidly increasing in price.

# 8. Heart Failure Risk Model

a. The leading cause of death within the United States of America is  heart disease\failure. This fatal disease takes a life of  an individual every 36 seconds in the USA today. Heart  Failure is generated from various conditions and activities that are  performed during an individual’s day to day lifestyle. Some  conditions include Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, and Anemia, while  other lifestyle conditions that help prevent Heart Failure is lack of  movement and smoking. Understanding the various issues that occur  within heart failure, as a user we would like to create a way to predict  if a patient is at risk of dying. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, I  created a model using Logistic Regression to attempt to try a predict if  a patient will be a risk within the near future. 

# 9. Credit K-Means Analysis

a. Credit is an important aspect that many individuals are not able to  understand within the world today. In fact, approximately, 16 percent  of Americans have incredibly poor credit, while only 1.2 percent of  Americans have perfect credit to work with. Individuals  within the world today take a line of credit from our banks each day.  The banks need to take in several determining factors to decide which individuals should qualify for a line of credit. This included age,  amount within their savings\checking account, duration, and purpose  of taking the credit. With all this information that the bank must  process, must understand how to decide on who to provide credit lines  too as well as how to market to them. This is where  clustering\segmentation comes into to play to assist with those  decisions. By using this method, we can determine how to  market each line of credit to each customer and understand each  situation. Understanding how to use this method properly we can create clusters from the bank data to discover new insights about the  group of customers.

# 10.Tennis Betting Analysis

a. Multiple States within the USA have allowed sports wagering to become  legalized over the last 3 years. In fact, over those last 3 years the states where  sports betting is legalized generated over $5 billion dollars in revenue (Legal  Sports Report). With the excitement of legalization of sports betting comes new  betters willing to put it all on the line to try and aspire to make a quick buck on the market. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and many individuals are  misinformed and fall victim to losing their bankroll. For this reason, I have  created a tennis betting analysis. Utilizing, simple betting strategies presented  from Action Network, I plan to not only showcase the dangers of betting without  a plan, but to also showcases where we can find simple betting opportunities on  the market (Action Network). Overall, the goal of the project is to make  newcomers to the betting community understand how to bet smart and increase  the odds within their favor when they decide to put the money on their line.
